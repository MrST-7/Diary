# Diary
I have long wanted to write a personal diary to keep my thoughts and analyze what is happening. Maybe someone needs it too)
To begin with, I will implement the main functionality:
- Registration and Login.
- Personal Area.
- Ability to enable, change or delete your notes with reference to the calendar.
- Also, I would like to add an internal task manager and the ability to set goals.
And of course, all this should work quietly on the mobile version.
Hello responsive layout!
